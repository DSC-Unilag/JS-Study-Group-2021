### (Week 2)(Data Types, Operators, Variables and Programming Environment)
- I have been able to learn about the different data types, operators and variables there are in JavaScript. I learnt about the assignment operator, logical operators and arithmetic operators; I learnt about operator precedence when dealing with arithmetic operators and I also learnt about special numbers like 'NaN' and 'inf' which respectively mean 'Not a number' and 'infinity,' which are like roadblocks, as it were, to arithmetic computing in JavaScript. I learnt about numbers, booleans and strings and how variables of these data types can easily be declared.
- Finally, I also learnt how to use browser logs to run JavaScript codes and commands.
